We at USDD had to come up with something truly new and unique. Our project stands for exclusivity and this is something weâ€™re bringing back to you guys by creating our own clothing brand. We will be designing exclusive merch that is seen worn by the Dripping Dino and Designer Dino NFTs. We'll also focus on making exclusive USDD Hoodies, T-Shirts, Jackets and Blouses.  </p>

Making sure that our community stays dripped out while supporting their favorite streamer/athlete. All clothing pieces will be carefully designed and crafted by stylists and manufacturers who have a ton of experience in the Fashion industry. Our clothing brand will in no way shape focus on being a form of fast fashion.</p>
